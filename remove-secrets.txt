## IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THIS FILE

The instructions in this file have been replaced by the `fix-secret.sh` script for better security.

Please use the script instead:

```bash
# Make it executable if needed
chmod +x fix-secret.sh

# Run the script - it will guide you through the process
./fix-secret.sh
```

The script is much more secure because it:
1. Doesn't store the secret in any files
2. Creates a temporary pattern file that is automatically deleted
3. Has better verification to ensure the secret is completely removed
